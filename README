This is a webscrapper that scrapes data(product details) from an Amazon webPage using node js & send the information as  a message to a client using Twiloi Api
The app is bound to break if the amazon webpage is modified or updated hence I advice one to  make changes to the tags, class or divs being referenced to find the various specified data(name, price)
